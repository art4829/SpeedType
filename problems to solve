    -Gonna work on the mainmenu for the game now.
    -I will make the noobest version of our firstpage game menu for now.
    - Also, maybe add a "modes" tabs- that includes easy/medium/hard levels
    - and like when u click that mode tab, maybe the three different levels could be a drop down? or on a new screen?
     IDK its up the the makers imagination
     - Let me know If you're interested making this tab.

    - Okay at first, the modes seems impossible to do.
    - cuz the way we implemented our code, we were only allowed to blit and drop a single word
    - So, to experiment, I made Harder_Modes_..... file in ScrapTestFiles.
    - THere, I had to create a dictionary for all the words to drop down.
    - Its not perfect yet, but its a good start I think.
    - Need to work with levels functionality now
